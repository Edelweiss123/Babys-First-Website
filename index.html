          <h3>Here are some super neat Fox Facts:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Biologically, they are the floofiest animals known to man.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>The scientific name of all 12 "true" fox species is <em> Vulpes vulpes</em>, which is just... really lazy, honestly. You couldn't think up two different words to describe them, scientists?</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>In the Furry community, foxes are generally considered horny submissives.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>While female foxes are Vixens, male foxes are Reynards and juvenile foxes are Kits.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Collectively, a group of foxes is called a 'skulk'.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Foxes are considered <em>Mesocarnivores</em>, which is an Omnivore that must derive at least 50% of its' diet from meat.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Foxes like to scream as loud as they possibly can when they bang--usually next to your trashcans and at 3am.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>An attractive male actor over 50 is known as a 'Silver Fox'.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>If you showed your children <em>Zootopia</em> at a certain formative stage in their life--like Robin Hood before him--Nick Wilde has already made your child a furry.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>While domesticated strains do exist, foxes still like to pee on everything and have musk glands, and so do not make great indoor pets.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>The previous fact will not stop you from researching how to obtain a pet fox.</li>
            <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Foxes are always the super-cunning villains or heroes in children's media why can't they ever just be like Random Concerned Citizen #4, huh?</li>
          </ul>
